After 10-20 hours working, I finally fix all the bugs after modifying the previous Jekyll framework. Now I can focus on the content! Here is my first blog!

Most typing rules with this blog framework are just like basic markdown rules.

1. Code fence:
   ```python
   def foo:
       return bar
   ```
2. Inline codes: `jekyll serve`
3. Math block:
    <p>$$P \propto e^{-E/k_BT}$$</p>
4. Inline math: $$F=ma$$
5. A quote:
   > All models are wrong, but some models are useful. $$\quad$$--- George Box
6. Table:
   
   | Syntax      | Description |
   | ----------- | ----------- |
   | Header      | Title       |
   | Paragraph   | Text        |
7. Link: [Emmy Noether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmy_Noether)
8. **Bold**, *Italian* and ~~delete line~~ 
9. Separating line:
