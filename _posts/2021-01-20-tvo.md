This is a reading note about paper *The Thermodynamic Variational Objective* ([arxiv.org/abs/1907.00031](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00031)) (and more). This paper provides a way to construct a tighter bound, called TVO, to observed likelihood in VAE than ELBO, base on a statistical physics intuition. There are two main points I want to make here: First, mordern statistical machine learning could borrow a lot from statistical physics field, as they generally share similar questions; Second, a tighter bound to learning objective does not always guarantee a better performance.

Let's start with some background about VAE, or varitaional inference, and ELBO:

$$y=ax$$
