This is a reading note about paper [*The Thermodynamic Variational Objective*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00031). This paper provides a tighter bound,  called TVO, to observed likelihood in VAE than ELBO, base on a statistical physics intuition. There are two main points I want to make in this note: First, mordern statistical learning could borrow a lot from statistical physics field; Second, a tighter bound to learning objective does not always guarantee a better performance.
