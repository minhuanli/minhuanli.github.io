title: About the Blog
description: I use the blog site to share my thoughts and some notes. The main site is designed for more general audience, so i will post random thoughts and short un-systematic notes with tags here. For accurate expressions, some blogs will be presented in my native language Chinese. But I will try to use English as much as possible, at least for tech notes. You can check them with <a href="https://minhuanli.github.io/">Home</a> or <a href="https://minhuanli.github.io/archive/">Archive</a> tab in the sidebar. <br>I have also constructed another notes site, which hosts more specific and systematic notes about academic topics I learned from courses, talks or discussions. I choose a <a href="https://github.com/clayh53/tufte-jekyll">Tufte</a> theme for that site, as I think a side note format is more than helpful to illustrate complex theoretic conceptions. You can go there through the <a href="https://minhuanli.github.io/research-notes/">Notes</a> tab on sidebar.
