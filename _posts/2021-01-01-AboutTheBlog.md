I utilize the blog site to share my reflections and various notes. The primary site is tailored for a broader audience, where I publish spontaneous musings and concise, informal notes with appropriate tags. To ensure precision, certain blog posts will be presented in my native language, Chinese. However, I make an effort to use English, particularly for technical notes. 
You can check them with <a href="https://minhuanli.github.io/">Home</a> or <a href="https://minhuanli.github.io/archive/">Archive</a> tabs in the sidebar. 

Furthermore, I've established a separate notes site dedicated to more specialized and organized annotations on academic subjects gleaned from courses, lectures, and discussions. I opted for a <a href="https://github.com/clayh53/tufte-jekyll">Tufte</a> theme for this site, as I believe the side note format is exceptionally beneficial for elucidating intricate theoretical concepts. You can navigate to this site via the <a href="https://minhuanli.github.io/notes/">Notes</a> tab on sidebar.
