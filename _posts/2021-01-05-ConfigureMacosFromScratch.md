The new macOS Big Sur has an impressively pretty UI, so today I tried to install it on my old 2015 macbook pro. This is not my primary working computer, as I am not sure if the Big Sur is stable enough and compatible with all my software. 
After the system installation, I reconfigured my favorite working environment from scratch. This is note could serve as a complete recipe.

* This will become a table of contents (this text will be scrapped).

### 1. Command Line Tools and Homebrew
